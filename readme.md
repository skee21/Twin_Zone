# **TwinZone - Ephemeral Chat Application**

TwinZone is a lightweight, real-time web application that allows users to create temporary, private chat rooms. Simply create a room, share the unique URL with a friend, and start chatting. The chat room and all its messages are automatically destroyed once the last person leaves, ensuring complete privacy and leaving no data behind.
